Autonomous agents that follow simple rules to create complex behavior.\
The algorithm mimics termites behavior of creating wood chip mounds. The termites wander and relocate chips to create mounds, the simulation finishes once there is only one mound. A mound is defined as at least 3 chips connected to each other.

Based on NetLogo [Termites](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Termites) model.

The video below is in real-time, the graph displays the number of mounds.\
The plane on which the termites move wraps around, so when they reach one end of the plane they "teleport" to the other end (this is configurable and can be turned off).
